# covid_case_forecasting

This repository contains a model for forecasts of new ICU admissions on disaggregated, regional, data. Data are taken from

- Italian cases, from the [Italian Civil Protection Department](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19).
- German cases from the [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html).

For a description of the model and for estimations and forecasts for Italian regions, have a look at the notebook folder.
